class AbstractScript(object):
    """
    The abstract base class for representing scripts.

    The script manager loads knowledge about external scripts based on a dict representation providing important
    information about that script. But this is only the most convenient human readable representation of the script
    knowledge. During the loading process, this dict information is converted into a script wrapper object. These
    have to be specific sub classes of this base class. Each specific implementation of this base class represents
    a different kind of script. And each type differs in how it is supposed to be handled / invoked. Some scripts may
    be python modules, bash scripts, php scripts or whatever. Each of those can be supported by creating a subclass
    which implements the appropriate way to handle an invocation.

    Any kind of script wrapper is constructed by passing the script definition dict (the way it was initially described
    by users) as the only argument to the constructor. This dict has to contain at least the following fields to
    describe a valid script:

    - name: The string identifier by which the script can be invoked from within the ufotest system. Passing this name
      will be required for the script manager to select the appropriate script.
    - author: The string describing the name (and mail address) of the author which has created the script
    - path: The ABSOLUTE string path to the actual script file.
    - description: A string description of the purpose of the script and potentially other information one should have
      about it's behavior

    **EXPECTED IMPLEMENTATIONS**

    A subclass is expected to implement the "invoke" method. This method is supposed to handle actual execution of the
    script. Aside from that there are no hard requirements. The method accepts one argument, which could be anything
    depending on what is needed for that specific class. And the method should return the outcome of the script
    execution in some way. If it is a multitude of information preferably as a dict.
