class Config(metaclass=Singleton):

    This is a singleton class, which implements the access to the config file.

    **DESIGN CHOICE**

    So I feel like I want to explain my reasoning for this class here. This is indeed not my first implementation for
    config access within this project. Previously I was simply loading the dictionary into global variable within this
    file and then I could import this global variable and just use the dictionary.

    But while working with that implementation I have found two major problems with it:

    (1) Reloading: The problem is that the dictionary is loaded into the global variable at exactly the point when
    it is imported the first time at some other module. This means that there is no way of globally reloading the
    config to react to file system changes for example. Even if you were to assign the variable with a new dict
    for example, this change would not translate to other files! The reloaded version would only be present in a single
    file. With a singleton of course you can simply solve this problem with a "reload" method.

    (2) Reacting to change: There is a significant downside to using the config dict directly without some sort of
    intermediary layer. If you need some functionality say "CONFIG['camera']['sensor_height']" then this is the path
    which is directly implemented like this in the config file structure. This means that if you were to change the
    structure of the config file you would have to change every occasion in the code, which uses this attribute...
    This is obviously a bad SOC. With a class you could write methods, which wrap certain behaviour. After a change
    only this method would have to be changed.

    **USAGE**

    In a sense the config singleton instance is the central data structure upon which all the other ufotest
    functionality relies. This instance needs to be accessible by all other code. This is for several reasons. The
    main reason is that this class wraps the access to all the values defined in the ufotest config file. Naturally
    much of the functionality is influenced by the concrete values of these config fields.

    Another reason is because the config singleton also contains the references to the essential plugin manager and
    script manager. The plugin manager is especially important, because it contains the registration of callbacks to
    specific hooks and the instance itself has to be used to invoke a certain hook.

    The config singleton is automatically created whenever this config module is first imported. This is also the point
    at which the config file is being read. So after this point, all the config values themselves can be accessed.
    But the plugin and script manager are NOT yet initialized for this to happen the "prepare" method has to be called
    at the very beginning of the new runtime.

    .. code-block:: python

        import Config from ufotest.config
        # At this point an instance of Config is already loaded and it also contains the values from the actual config
        # file

        # This does not actually create a new instance but returns the only existing one "Config" is a singleton class
        config = Config()
        # Only after this line the plugin manager is actually initialized
        config.prepare()

        # Internally the config instance saves the toml structure as a dict. This is the bad way to access the config
        # values since that structure is subject to change.
        config.data['ci']['hostname']
        # Better use the dedicated wrapper method
        config.get_hostname()

        # The plugin manager is saved as "pm"
        config.pm.do_action('my_custom_action')

        # The script manager is saved as "sm"
