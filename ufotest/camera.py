    This is the abstract base class for wrapping access to a specific camera.

    **DESIGN CHOICE**

    Here is the reasoning for why this is necessary: Previously the access to the camera was managed by a few isolated
    functions in this module. That was a simpler and less bloated version, but it also was not sub optimal for the
    following reasons:

    (1) There is the desire to be able to actually use different cameras with the ufotest framework. The isolated
    functions only implemented access to one specific model. So the reasonable alternative is to defines a set of
    methods which have to be implemented by every camera and other than that leave room for individual requirements.
    This needs an interface (this very class in other words)

    (2) Representing the camera by a class has a secondary advantage: A class has a state. This leaves the option to
    potentially cache certain values from the camera interaction and thus be more efficient. Or some functionality
    inherently requires an external state management.

    outcome of "supports_prop" is defined by whether or not the prop is defined in this default dict.
