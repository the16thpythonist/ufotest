History
=======

0.1.0 (13.08.2020)
------------------

- First release on PyPI.

0.2.0 (23.08.2020)
------------------

- First actual release with content
    - "install" command to install ufotest command automatically
    - "config" command to edit global configuration file
    - "frame" command to acquire and display a single frame

0.3.0 (24.08.2020)
------------------

- Added additional package for SUSE which installs c++ compiler
- Fixed unhandled exception in "frame"
- Added additional output if a cmake installation fails
- fixed readme
- Added "init" command, which will setup the installation folder and the config file

0.3.1 (25.08.2020)
------------------

- Small adjustments to the documentation
- Added "status.sh" and "reset.sh" scripts from michele to the main code folder.

0.4.0 (27.08.2020)
------------------

- Added installation packages for OpenSUSE to the documentation
- Copied the power up and power down scripts from the IPE
- Copied the vivado start script from the IPE
- Now checking for a valid ufotest installation before every command, thus preventing running into an obvious exception.
- Added jinja2 to the requirements
- Added module "camera.py" instead of "capture.py" to contain all the camera related functionality
- Modified config file
    - Added "scripts" section, which allows the user to register custom commands.
- Added the "script" command: Executes (bash) scripts, which were registered in the project
- Added functions which setup and teardown the camera state
    - Execute them in "frame" command
- Added an option to "config" which allows to specify the editor

0.4.1 (27.08.2020)
------------------

- Fixed the MANIFEST.in file, which did not include the bash scripts in the distribution package

0.4.2 (01.09.2020)
------------------

- Removed the setup and teardown process from the "frame" command, because as of right now,
  the power up and down should not be called too often, because there are problems with the FPGA regarding that.
- registered 2 new scripts
    - pcie_init
    - reset_fpga
- Changed the parameter type for the output of the frame command from Path to File in the hopes of making it
  able to overwrite like this
- Fixed the image display using matplotlib

0.5.0 (01.09.2020)
------------------

- Moved the code to import a number N of raw images from a file to it's own function in camera.py
- Added commands:
    - setup: Will enable the camera to work
    - teardown: Will disable the camera to work. Be careful not to use this while the FPGA still has problems with
      power down
    - list-scripts: Displays a list of all scripts
- Registered scripts
    - reset_tp: Resets the fpag and enables the test pattern
    - reset_dma: Resets the DMA settings of the fpga
- Moved the scripts into their own folder
- Removed the installation of vivado. This is the responsibility of the user. Installation path can be given in the
  config file
- Added the necessary scripts for the flashing of the fpga
- changed "execute_script" so that changes folder to the script folder first

0.5.1 (01.09.2020)
------------------

- Enabled Sphinx autodoc
- The "frame" command now removes the prior frame buffer file before saving the new one
- Updated the "usage" section of the documentation

0.5.2 (10.09.2020)
------------------

- Added the file "VERSION" which will be used to set the current version of the project. This file will also be read
  used for the setup.py. The reasoning to create this is that it can also be used for a --version option for the CLI
- Added the option "--version" to the cli group

0.5.3 (10.09.2020)
------------------

- Fixed the inclusion of the VERSION file into the code package


0.6.0 (10.09.2020)
------------------

- Changed the config names "camera_height" and "camera_width" to "sensor_height" and "sensor_width"
- moved the "package_install" section within the config to the individual sections for the OS's. So now this does not
  have to be changed by the user, but instead is specific for the chosen operating system.
- Added the new "flash" command which can be used to flash a new .BIT file to the fpga
    - It uses the "vivado" command from an existing vivado installation to flash the bit file.
- extended the "usage" section of the documentation with the new flash command


0.7.0 (18.09.2020)
------------------

- Added the new "test" command, which will execute a camera test procedure
    - Added the "tests" subfolder within the package, which will hold files that define these kind of test routines.
    - Added the TestRunner class which will be used to execute all these tests
    - Added the AbstractTest class, which will act as the base class for defining new camera tests
    - Added the TestReport class, which will wrap the results of the execution of a TestRunner
    - Added the TestSuite class, which will represent a test suite consisting of multiple tests
- Added the "tests" section in the config file.
- Fixed the "camera_height" to "sensor_height" in the camera.py module
- Added the module "_testing.py", which provides utilities for unittesting of the project
    - Added the UfotestTestCase as a extension of the default unittest TestCase, which sets up the project installation
      folder within a temporary folder
- Tests
    - Fixed the errors within "test_ufotest"
    - Added "test_testing" which contains test cases for testing the TestRunner class
- Added a "--force" flag to the "init" command, which will delte the entire installation tree first and then reinstalls
  it


0.8.0 (23.09.2020)
------------------

- Fixes
    - Fixed a broken dict index in install command
    - Fixed wrong config in _testing.py
    - Fixed naming error in default.toml
- Documentation
    - Added a short description for the items in the table of contents
    - Added a stub for an additional section which will contain notes about the camera itself
    - Changed the recommended way of installation to "from source" because then you could also run
      the unittests, which is pretty important
- Added the "archive" folder to be created with the "init" command. This folder will contain the results of
  the execution of a test runner.
- Added the "Config" singleton class, which should be used for config access in the future...
- Added a "general" section in the config file, which will store the date time format configuration for now, but
  will be used in the future for all configuration, which is not bound to any particular topic.
- Added the class "AbstractRichOutput", which will serve as an interface for all classes (mainly related to the
  testing functionality) which are supposed to implement plaintext, markdown and latex conversions...+
- Using jinja2 for templating in the project now
- Added the "templates" folder to the project. This folder will contain jinja2 templates, which will be used to
  generate the output for the test reports etc.
- Implemented Markdown conversion for TestReport and TestMetadata. The markdown versions of the test reports are now
  saved in an archive
- Added pytest to the requirements.txt

0.8.1 (23.09.2020)
------------------

- Fixes
    - Changed the file mode of the templates
    - Fixed the way to acces the sensor dimensions in the install.py module
- Documentation
    - Added the installation of python tkinter as a requirement
    - Changed the installation instructions to not use sudo anymore, but instead to modify PATH
- Added a "debian" option as operating system in the config file


0.8.2 (30.09.2020)
------------------

- Fixes
    - "test" command had the execution of a suite and a single test switched around
    - fixed the "get_command_output" function which was not working
    - fixed a minor issue in the test report markdown template
- Added
    - The run method of a single "AbstractTest" is now wrapped int a try/except statement.
    - The class "AssertionTestResult", which can be used for tests to define assertion cases.
        - Unittests for this class
    - Test suite "full" which is meant to contain all the tests in the future
- Changes
    - The "no-dependencies" flag of the "install" command now only skips the system packages
- Documentation
    - Extended "usage" with how to use the "test" command
    - Added additional section "tests", which explains how to write a custom test class.

0.8.3 (30.09.2020)
------------------

Fixes

- Fixed the access to the config values of the camera dimensions in the function which acquires
  a frame.
- fixed the install command

Changes

- Updated the readme

0.9.0 (05.12.2020)
------------------

Additions

- Added the python package 'md-to-html' to the list of requirements. It will be needed to convert the markdown output
  of the reports into actual html pages which can be viewed.
- Implemented a utility function to convert a markdown file into an html file.
- Added the python library 'flask' to the requirements. This library will be used to start a simple web server which
  will be responsible for reacting to the github hooks when new changes have been made to the repository.
- Added the 'ci' section to the config file. It contains all information which is necessary for the ci functionality
  such as the remote source repository url, which is to be monitored, the branch which is to be cloned and the public
  hostname of the host machine.
- Added new command group 'ci' which will contain all the commands necessary for the continuous integraion
  functionality of the application.
  - Added the 'run' command. It will clone the repository which was defined in the config file, flash the new version
  of the bitfile from the repo to the hardware and then run a test suite with this new hardware configuration.
  this command also aves a copy of the bit file version which was used for the process in the archive.
  - Added the 'serve' command. It will start a minimal flask web server which listens to the post request generated by
  the remote repository whenever a new commit has been pushed.
- The flask server, which is used to respond to git webhooks also serves the static files from the archive, which means
  that no additional nginx server has to be installed.

Changes

- Changed the function which clones the git repos to also be able to clone specific branches
- Started to unify the style of the console output of all the commands
- Reworked the "init" command to use the new style of console output, include a 'verbose' option and it now catches the
  error correctly if the folder already exists and the force flag is not set.

Documentation

- Added documentation which explains how to setup an nginx server to be able to view the test reports remotely using
  a browser.
- Fixed the issues with the documentation not building
- Fixed the Logo not being displayed in the documentation version of the readme


0.9.1 (06.12.2020)
------------------

Additions

- Added a little bit of a convenience function to the ci web server: When visiting the root web site. It will display
  a little help text now to see that the server is indeed running.

Changes

- Changed the route for the ci server which accepts the source control web requests from '/push' to '/push/github'
  because this leaves open the possibility to implement the custom web hooks of other source control systems in the
  future.

Documentation

- Added Documentation for the ci functions of the ufotest app


0.10.0 (17.12.2020)
-------------------

Additions

- A module 'ufotest.ci.email' which implements the functionality of sending emails in response to ci actions, which
  inform the different contributors of the package about the outcome of automated build triggers.
- The flask server now also serves the static html files from the 'builds' report folder
- Added a new folder 'static' to the project, which will contain all the static assets needed for the flask CI web
  server. These assets are mainly CSS and JS files as well as images etc. With the 'init' command this folder is being
  copied to the installation folder of the application. This is also the place where the files are actually being
  served. This has the advantage, that the files could be modified by the users.

Changes

- Fixed the broken code blocks in the CI part of the documentation.
- Moved the 'get_repository_name' function from ufotest.install to ufotest.util. Seems more intuitive
- Added the abstract method 'to_html' to the abstract base class AbstractRichOutput. Since it is now the plan that all
  relevant generated reports etc would be able to be viewed remotely over a web server, it would make sense to also
  generate the necessary html for this in the specific classes.
- Renamed the 'ci run' command to 'ci build'. I am referring to the process as a 'build' in all the comments and the
  documentation, so it is more consitent to actually also call the command itself like this
- Completely reworked the process of how the ci build works.
    - The ufotest installation folder now has an additional folder called 'builds' which will act as an archive for the
      build process much like the 'archive' folder works for test run reports. Having both of these seperately now is
      more consistent, becauses not every test run has to be part of a build, but every build contains a test run.
      the build report now simply links to the test report.
    - The implementation for this new process is in the module ufotest.ci.build
- Updated readme with credits for flask web framework

Documentation

- Renamed all occurrances of the build process to use the new name 'build' instead of 'run'


0.11.0 (14.01.2021)
-------------------

Additions

- TestReport now also generates an html page, which means that an online version of the test report can also be
  delivered using the CI server.
- AbstractTest cases now also have a "description" property where the test can be described. This description is then
  rendered to the test report as well
- The test reports and the build reports now also save as JSON files. This is important for procedurally parsing the
  information about a report later on, as it is needed for example to generate a list of all the tests/reports...
- CI server now also has a home page


Changes

- Changed the name of the static asset "build_report.css" to just "report.css". The very same stylesheet is also being
  used for the test report page.
- Added the new properties "repository_url" and "documentation_url" under the "general" section of the config file.
  These values are needed to display them in the web pages of the CI server.
- Refactored the testing procedure: Deprecated the old implementations of TestRunner, TestReport and TestMetadata and
  replaced them with new implementations.
  Added the new class TestContext. The way the testing process is now implemented internally functions much the same
  way as the build system. A new context manager has to be created for each new test run. This context is then first
  passed to the test runner, which actually executes the tests and writes the results back to the context. This "filled"
  context can then be passed to the test report constructor for the reporting functionality.
- Removed the "email" option from the "test" command.
- The jinja templates for the CI web server now use template inheritance, which was used to add a default header to
  each web page, which can be used to navigate between the most important pages.

Documentation

- Changed the documentation for the new "serve" command


0.12.0 (14.01.2021)
-------------------

Additions

- Added a test result class which allows to add images as a result.
- Added a test result class which allows to add dicts as a result.
- Test case which simply requests a frame from the camera and adds the image to the test report.
- Test case which requests frame and calculates simple statistics for it.

Changes

- Reworked the "mock" test case to now return a combined test result of one test result object for each available
  test result class. The mock test case thus became a way of testing test results classes.
- Fixed an error with including the static css files within the HTML templates of the CI server.
- Fixed the combined test result not having an html conversion.
- Changed the "serve" command: Now it has not arguments anymore. Both the hostname and the port now have to be defined
  in the config file. I realized that the html files for the reports are being created in separate instances of the
  application, which are not the running server and thus do not know the hostname or the port. This has lead to
  errors in the creation of the absolute url links within the html templates.

Documentation

- Changed the documentation for the "serve" command again


1.0.0 (15.01.2021)
------------------

Additions

- Created a new system for handling the builds. previously any build which was triggered while another one was still
  running would be rejected. Now there is a build Queue. When a build is triggered, it is added to this queue, which
  is essentially just a json file with a list. Then there is a separate process started by the "serve" command which
  only checks this queue and executes the build requests saved within.

Changes

- Fixed: The stylesheet for the build report html template was not linked to correctly.
- Fixed: There was an issue where the program would crash if two build would be triggered at the same hour and minute
  of the day since they would attempt to create folders with the same name. Added the build commit and the second of
  to the folder name format to fix.
- Fixed the bug that a build would not save the test reports properly.
- Fixed the build report url within the report email.

Documentation

- Updated the section about continuous integration.

1.0.1 (13.02.2021)
------------------

Changes

- Changed the date format in the HISTORY.rst file
- Changed the default port from 2424 to 8030

1.0.2 (14.02.2021)
------------------

Changes

- The flask server now binds to "0.0.0.0" which is required to access it from an outside scope
- TODO: Add an option to the "serve" command so that this can be overwritten

Additions

- An API route for gitlab push webhooks
- An adapter class to format the data from the gitlab webhook correctly

1.0.3 (24.02.2021)
------------------

Fixes

- Now actually using the config.static in the jinja templates, which enables the assets to be loaded correctly.

1.1.0 (20.03.2021)
------------------

Added

- unittests in "tests/test_build.py", which are concerned with testing the build process.
- unittests in "tests/test_config.py", which are concerned with testing the functionality exposed by the config module
- Added "FigureTestResult" which allows to add a matplotlib figure directly as the result of a test.
- Added camera test "RepeatedResetTest"
- Added camera test "RepeatedFrameTest"
- Added camera test "CalculatePairNoiseTest"
- Added camera test "RepeatedCalculatePairNoiseTest"

Changes

- The "serve" command now has the option "host" which enables the specification of a different host IP address to bind
  the web server to.
- The joining of paths is now integrated into the "get_path" function within the config module.
- The "flash" command now provides more output and the command produces an accurate return code in the case of an error
- Renamed the main method of the BuildRunner from "build" to "run". Added the option to skip the clone and flash steps
  (for testing purposes). Furhtermore the method does not return a build report anymore, it has to be seperately
  constructed.
- Deprecated "execute_script" with new version "run_script"
- The "test" command now has better console output and actually returns a meaningful error code
- The "init" command now has a flag "update" which only replaced the static assets and leaves the rest of the
  installation intact.

Fixes

- Fixed the ufotest unittests to work with the new system of using the TestContext to construct the TestRunner
- Now only importing matplotlib exactly before the frame is actually to be displayed, because previously the "frame"
  command would break in a headless SSH session, even if the frame was not even intended to be displayed...
- The "ci build" command now actually uses the test suite which is passed as the argument. Previously it would always
  use the default option defined within the config file.
- Attempting to release the build lock when it is not locked not raises the appropriate exception.
- Attempting to construct a test report from a test context without an actual test run being executed before now raises
  the appropriate exceptions
- The build lock is now uses the correct folder which can be changed at runtime.
- The build process now properly fails when the flash command fails.
- BuildWorker process now does not crash when a KeyboardInterrupt is received.
- BuildWorker process does not crash when the build process fails and also not when the email sending fails.
- If test suite is currently processing, one cannot access the test archive list in the web interface
  presumably because the test folder already exists but no reports have been saved to it. The best course for
  fixing this would be to prevent a crash for an empty test folder alltogether.
- Build and test reports are now properly sorted by start date within the web interface
- FIXED: The test are not executed in the order in which they are specified in the config file
- FIXED: Not necessarily a bug with this code but with the way the camera works: I feel like there is a problem with how the
  decoding of the images works. I feel like all the images accumulate within the internal buffer of the camera and they
  are ALL being read out with each call to ipedecode?

1.1.1 (27.05.2021)
------------------

Changes

- Added "Development" section to the README
- Changed the "_testing.UfotestTestCase" to be a mixin "_testing.UfotestTestMixin" instead of a inherited child
  class of TestCase, because that caused unnecessary duplication of test methods and a Bug during testing.
- Added a test file for the CLI
- Updated "install.install_pcitools" function to return result dict, use verbose and force fields of config
- Reworked command "install". It now accepts two arguments, where the first one is the string name of the dependency
  to install and the second one is the path into which to install. This command is now used to install individual
  dependencies. The full installation will be made with another command.
- Changed "testing.FigureTestResult" to save the matplotlib figure with minimal
  whitespace


Bug fixes

- The "reload" method of Config overwrites the values and thus gets rid of the "context" field which is
  only set in the constructor of the class.
- Fixed all the test cases, such that they *should* all pass now.
- "tests.frame.AcquireSingleFrame" fails because a call to plt.subplots gets the wrong parameters.
- "tests.frame.AcquireSingleFrame" fails sometimes if the pixel values are too homogeneous and the difference of the
  0.1 and 0.9 quantile values comes down to zero. The procedure to increase contrast then causes a division by
  zero exception


1.1.2 (30.05.2021)
------------------

Changes

- All the installation methods for the repository requirements are now updated to return a dict with information about
  the installation process and should thus work now with the "install" command
- Added the "install-all" command. Since the install command is now used to install individual dependencies, this
  command can be used to install all of the dependencies and the required system packages all at once.


1.2.0 (09.06.2021)
------------------

Plugin System: This version introduces the initial implementation of the plugin system. The plugin system should make
it possible to write plugins for ufotest, which modify and extend it's core behaviour in a reversible, modular fashion
which does not require a permanent modification to the core source code.

- Added the module "plugin.py" which is supposed to contain all the code, which implements a plugin system for ufotest
- Added the class "plugin.PluginManager". During construction of the config singleton a new instance of plugin manager
  is created as the config attribute "pm". It then loads all plugins from a folder which is specified in the config
  option "general" -> "plugin_folder". These plugins can register callbacks to action and filter hooks which will then
  be executed within ufotests routines at those points where the respective action and filter hooks are being called
- Added the module "hooks.py", which contains the two classes "hooks.Action" and "hooks.Filter". These classes act as
  decorators which can be used in plugins to register functions as hook callbacks
- Added a section "hooks" to the project docs, which will contain a listing and description of all available hooks for
  plugin development.
- Added the test module "test_plugin.py" with unittests for the plugin system.

Script Management: The basic script management has been rewritten with a more extensive system for managing the scrips.
This new system was designed with two goals in mind: (1) The camera interaction scripts are supposed to be subject to
the CI version control itself and (2) The script behavior should be modifyable by hooks.

- Reworked the module "scripts.py"
- Added the class "scripts.ScriptManager" which will be the central hub for loading the scripts and for interacting
  with them (by invoking them for example). An instance of this script manager will be part of the config singleton and
  thus accessible from anywhere.
- Added the class "scripts.AbstractScript" as an abstract base class for specific implementations of script wrapper
  classes, which internally wrap the functionality of interacting with different kinds of scripts.
- Added the class "scripts.BashScript" as an initial implementation for a script wrapper for interacting with simple
  bash scripts.
- Added the test module "test_script.py" with unittests for the script management system.
- Added the fallback scripts "hello_world.sh" for testing purposes only

Changes

- The main "config.Config" singleton was changes quite a bit: This singleton now also manages instances of the plugin
  manager and the script manager. These instances cannot be created in the constructor of Config because they rely on
  the config file itself. They are initialized by calling the "prepare" method externally. This should happen as far in
  the runtimes start as possible!
- Removed the two cli commands "script" and "list_scripts" in favor of the reworked script management system.
- Updated the README.rst to now also contain instructions for the installation of the project dependencies using either
  the "install" command or the "install-all" command.

1.2.1 (14.06.2021)
------------------

Changes

- Added the filter hook "get_version" which modifies the version string for the project.

Fixes

- There was bug which invoked the init of the plugin system when attempting to make an initial installation of
  ufotest using the "init" command, but the plugin system init requires a valid config file to exist, which presents a
  deadlock and caused the program not to be able to be installed at all. This is fixed by preventing the
  plugin system to be loaded for the init command.

1.2.2 (15.06.2021)
------------------

Changes

- Added the action hook "pre_command" which is executed right at the start of every CLI command

Fixes

- The "init" command for creating the installation folder now actually also creates the plugins
  folder.

2.0.0 (xx.07.2021)
------------------

**THIS VERSION BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.** The compatibility is probably violated in several places, but the most
important change is probably a major change of how the test report html files are rendered. This will likely cause
the web interface of existing installations to be unusable

Fixes

- The "setup" and "teardown" script previously still used the old script system. Now they also use the camera class.
- The tests now also use the Camera class which is passed to them by the test runner and not the old method
- When using the "--mock" option, the "flash" command will not attempt to actually flash anything, the code is just
  skipped
- The "flash" step of the build process now properly replicates the main process command line options "mock" and
  "verbose" when invoking the "flash" command in a sub shell.
- Getting the most recent build is now based on the filesystem creation date of the folder and not the json report file
  which may not exists yet at the moment of inquiry (This was a bug before)
- When the flashing process during a build fails, the build is not discarded but saved as a report nonetheless. The
  test suite is still executed.
- A build script is not promised to be existing on the assumption that it "should" alone. The script manager now
  actually checks if the script file exists.

Changes

- Added additional methods to be implemented for the interface "camera.AbstractCamera": "supports_prop", "set_prop" and
  "get_prop" which can be used to manipulate internal properties of the camera.
- Added "camera.InternalDictMixin" which is a mixin, which implements the management of camera internal props by using
  a central dict. Provides default implementations for the relevant abstract methods of
  "camera.AbstractCamera"
- The "frame" command now uses the UfoCamera class to retrieve it's images.
- Added the module "noise.py" to the default list of camera tests. It is supposed to contain all those test cases which
  are in some way concerned with the calculation of noise characteristics for the camera.
- Added "tests.noise.CalculateDarkPhotonTransferCurve" which sweeps different values for the cameras exposure time
  and then calculates the noise for each one, plotting those results at the end.
- Added "tests.noise.MeasureNoiseMixin" which can be used for easy access to a method which wraps the measurement of
  camera noise by taking two independent frames and then calculating the variance of the frame difference
- Changed the way the jinja template environment is managed: It is now also part of the main config singleton. And
  a filter hook applies to the loaders which are registerd to this environment, allowing plugins to register custom
  template folders.
- Changed the test report and the test context to now also have fields sensor, hardware and firmware version.
- Added a really convenient "--mock" option to the main ufotest command of the CLI. This will register a filter which
  makes all subsequent code use the MockCamera class instead of the default UfoCamera class. By using this simple
  option it should for example be possible to use every camera class compatible test case with the mock camera as well
  from the command line.
- Added "ci recompile" command to the CLI. This command will render the test report html files again using the
  information within the report.json file. This command exists for the case that config changes for the web interface
  have been made. On default these would not be reflected within the static test report html files.
- Added "util.HTMLTemplateMixin" a mixin class which provides a default implementation of the "to_html" method.
- During a build, the cloned repository itself is now also completely copied into the build archive folder. This is
  necessary to retrieve the scripts from that version later on.
- The test report template now creates a table of contents of sorts which consists of links that point to the
  corresponding section of the html page with the detailed report about each test case
- Added a new test case "loaded_scripts" which checks if all scripts are indeed loaded as a build version from the
  remote repository.
- Added a new test case "scripts_syntax" which checks the syntax of all loaded scripts.
- Extended the abstract base class AbstractScript with a default method "check_syntax" which can be overwritten by the
  specific subclass implementations to implement custom syntax check routines for the corresponding script types. Did
  this to enable it being used in the "scripts_syntax" test case. Already implemented it for the BashScript type. Also
  this is optional with a default implementation.
- The home page now shows an additional widget for the disk usage of ufotest. Two fields: one for the used disk space
  and one for the remaining available disk space on the host PC. This change was prompted by the fact, that now the
  entire source repo is saved for every build. This *could* explode the disk usage rapidly so better to keep an eye on
  it.
- Added a custom jinja filter "format_byte_size" which converts an integer amount of bytes into a pretty formatted
  string of another byte related unit.

Hooks

- Added the action hook "pre_command_frame" which is called at the start of the "frame" CLI command.
- Added filter hook "camera_class" which will be used to retrieve the AbstractCamera subclass to use to interface with
  the actual camera hardware.
- Added filter hook "home_recent_count" for the int amount of recent tests and builds to be displayed on the home page
  of the web interface.
- Added filter hook "home_template" which allows to change the jinja template which is being used to display the home
  page.
- Added filter hook "home_status_summary" which allows to modify the individual data fields which are displayed
  in the summary box of the homepage
- Added filter hook "template_loaders" which allows to register custom plugin template files for jinja2 templates, so
  that they will be appropriately discovered by the main system. Only if this is used, the plugin templates can extend
  the native ufotest templates, which they should!
- Added action hook "modify_template_environment" which can be used to modify the main jinja Environment instance which
  is used to render all the templates. This allows a plugin for example to define custom template globals and filters.

Web Interface

- Added "FontAwesome" to the static assets. This is a CSS/JS library for adding Icon support to a web site. These icons
  are supposed to be used for the web interface of ufotest.
- Added "CodeMirror" to the static assets. This is a JS library which essentially adds a code editor widget, which can
  be used to edit code of various languages complete with syntax highlighting... This will be used to implement the
  TOML config file editor for the web interface.
- Added a new nav item "Config" which directs to a page where the config file can be viewed, edited and
  then saved.
- Added actual content for the home page. The home page now displays some summary information about the ufotest
  software itself, the hardware and the firmware for the currently connected camera. The information about the camera
  is derived from the details of the most recent test report. Additionally, the home page will display lists of the
  most recent test and build reports.
- Completely switched from plain CSS files to using SCSS for the static stylesheet assets of the web interface. These
  will not be compiled in time though. They should be compiled during development so that the installable version of
  ufotest can be shipped with the compiled CSS versions of those files.

Documentation

- Added "plugin.rst": In the future this should contain a minimal tutorial for how to setup a ufotest plugin.
- Extended "hooks.rst"
- Docstrings for "testing.TestRunner"
- Docstrings for "camera.AbstractCamera"
- Docstrings for "camera.MockCamera"
- Docstrings for "camera.UfoCamera"
