    """
    This mixin can be used to provide a default implementation of the "to_html" method for the
    AbstractRichOutput interface. This implementation uses a jinja template string to render the html version of the
    object instance.

    **USAGE**

    Any class which inherits from this mixin has to define a static class member called "HTML_TEMPLATE" which is
    supposed to be the string representation of the jinja template to be rendered for the HTML representation. Upon
    calling the "to_html" method, this template will be passed a context where "self" references to the actual
    object instance, which allows for all the instance attributes to be used in the template. Within the template
    string all jinja syntax can be used. In fact, within the template the ufotest jinja environment is loaded, which
    means that there is even access to the global context variable "config".

    .. code-block:: python

        class Custom(HTMLTemplateMixin):

            HTML_TEMPLATE = "<p>{{ self.text }}</p>"

        c = Custom()
        c.to_html() # <p>Hello World</p>

    **RECOMPILING**

    Aside from this main functionality, the more important feature is that this mixin also enables the inheriting class
    to be recompilable from the JSON / dict representation. For that, we first define this use case: Assuming we have
    saved an objects attributes as a json file and now load it again such that all the attribute values are part of a
    dict. Now we want to render the HTML template using this dict representation. For this case, the mixin adds it's
    own implementation of "to_dict" which is used to convert it into json in the first place. This method saves the
    template string as a json field. The static method "html_from_dict" can now be used on such a dict to render the
    html template from it, without needing an actual object instance.

    .. code-block:: python

        class Custom(HTMLTemplateMixin):

            HTML_TEMPLATE = "<p>{{ self.text }}</p>"

            def __init__(self):
                HTMLTemplateMixin.__init__(self)
                self.text = "Hello World"

            def to_dict(self):
                # It is important that the mixins implementation of to_dict is considered here!
                return {
                    **HTMLTemplateMixin.to_dict(self),
                    # It is also important that all the dict fields have the same name as the instance attributes
                    'text': self.text
                }

        c = Custom()
        c_dict = c.to_dict()
        c_dict['text'] = 'Bye World'
        HTMLTemplateMixin.html_from_dict(c_dict) # <p>Bye World</p>

        **DESIGN CHOICE**

        Why does this method exists? On first glance it is useless, because it only returns a static value. At any
        position where this method is used, one could just use the actual value instead. This is correct, but this
        method exists for possible future changes. It wraps access to the template string, which means that the actual
        access to this template string can easily be changed. In the future it would be possible to replace the class
        constant with a object attribute for the template string rather easily if that is desired. More conveniently,
        having this method allows a subclass to potentially overwrite it with very custom behavior!
