    """
    This class wraps the main loop which is responsible for actually executing the build jobs.

    This class was designed so that it's run method could essentially be used as the main loop of an entirely different
    subprocess. Its main loop periodically checks the build queue for the case that new build jobs have arrived over
    the web server.

    **The build data**

    So the basic way the build queue works is that the web server receives a new build job in the form of a json data
    structure. This data structure is then put into the build queue until it is popped out again by this worker process.
    To understand the build process it is important to understand how this json data from the build queue is structured.
    The most important parts are explained here:

    - repository
        - owner
            - *email*: The string email address of the owner of the repository. This will be used to send a report mail
              to the owner whenever a build has finished.
            - *name*: The string name of the owner of the repo. This is used to correctly address the person in the mail
        - *clone_url*: The string url with which the repository can be cloned. This is then used to actually clone the
          repository to flash the most recent changes to the camera.
    - pusher
        - *email*: The string email address of the person which caused the most recent push to the repository.
        - *name*: The string name of the pusher
    - *ref*: A string with the branch name to which the commit was issued. For the ufotest application only a certain
      branch is being monitored. This will be used to check if the changes have actually occurred on the relevant branch
    - *commits*: A list of strings, where each string is the string identifier for one of the commits for the
      repository. The last one will be used as the string to checkout and use as the basis for the tests.

    This should have been committed
