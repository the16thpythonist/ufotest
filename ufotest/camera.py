    This is the abstract base class for wrapping access to a specific camera.

    Here is the reasoning for why this is necessary: Previously the access to the camera was managed by a few isolated
    functions in this module. That was a simpler and less bloated version, but it also was not sub optimal for the
    following reasons:

    (1) There is the desire to be able to actually use different cameras with the ufotest framework. The isolated
    functions only implemented access to one specific model. So the reasonable alternative is to defines a set of
    methods which have to be implemented by every camera and other than that leave room for individual requirements.
    This needs an interface (this very class in other words)

    (2) Representing the camera by a class has a secondary advantage: A class has a state. This leaves the option to
    potentially cache certain values from the camera interaction and thus be more efficient. Or some functionality
    inherently requires an external state management.

    **EXAMPLE**

    In the order of the multiple inheritance, the mixins are best placed first. This mixin furthermore expects the
    subclass to define a static attribute "default_values", which is a dict and contains the default values for all the
    props. This dict should contain all (and only) entries for each prop which is supported by the camera, because the
    outcome of "supports_prop" is defined by whether or not the prop is defined in this default dict.

    returns a static picture which is based on the "sample.png" image from the static folder of the ufotest
    installation. The image itself displays some kind of landscape.

    The camera does indeed require the "set_up" method to be called before any frames can be captured. This is however
    not due to any specific reason. The setup status is internally simple represented as a boolean flag. This is to
    simulate camera behavior as well as possible.

    **EXPOSURE TIME**

    This class supports the "exposure_time" prop. It can be set as int values between 1 and 100. This class actually
    attempts to simulate the effects of exposure time somewhat. With higher values the static image becomes (1)
    brighter, as in higher pixel values overall and (2) there is more noise: The magnitude of the additive gaussian
