Example 1: A hello world plugin
===============================

It is assumed, that the necessary folder structure for the plugin was already setup using the
the :doc:`cookiecutter template <../../plugin/setup_cookiecutter>`.

This document will show an example for a minimalistic plugin, which only has the following
functionality:

- Add a new CLI command which simple prints "Hello World"
- Add a new test case, which simply adds "Hello World" as the test result
- Print "Hello World" before every test run
