            <!-- EXPLANATION OF WHAT A BUILD EVEN IS -->

            <h2>Explanation</h2>

            <p class="explanation">
                This is an automatically generated document, which contains the results of an ufotest build. A build refers
                to the process of cloning the camera source code directory, flashing the new version of the configuration
                from the repository to the hardware and running an automated test suite on the resulting hardware
                configuration.
            </p>
            <p class="documentation">
                <a href="https://github.com/the16thpythonist/ufotest">UfoTest</a> is an application which aims to implement
                unit testing and CI functionality for the UFO camera hardware which was developed at the IPE. The
                Documentation for the project can be found here:

            <!-- DESCRIBING THE BUILD CONTEXT -->
            <h2>Build Context</h2>

            <p class="context-time">
                The build was started at <strong>{{ report.start }}</strong> and ended <strong>{{ report.end }}</strong>
                with a total duration of <strong>{{ report.duration }} minutes</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="context-repo">
                The build is based on a clone of the source repository called <strong>{{ report.repository }}</strong>.
                Specifically, the commit <strong>{{ report.commit }}</strong> from the branch
                <strong>{{ report.branch }}</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="context-folder">
                Information about this build was saved in the 'builds' folder of the ufotest application on the machine,
                which is currently hosting the ufotest application and thus the CI server. This specific report is saved
                in the sub folder called <strong>{{ report.folder }}</strong>.<br>
                This folder also contains the <strong>.BIT file</strong> which was flashed to the hardware to
                produce the following results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bit file responsible for these test results can be downloaded here:
                <a href="./{{ report.bitfile_name }}">BIT File</a>
            </p>

            <!-- SHOWING THE TEST RESULTS -->
            <h2>Test Results</h2>

            <p class="test-results">
                The test suite which was executed on the camera hardware, after the new version of the software was flashed,
                is called <strong>{{ report.test_suite }}</strong>. This suite contains a total of
                <strong>{{ report.test_count }}</strong> separate test cases. The specific names of these test cases can
                be seen in the <em>separate test report</em>.<br>
                This test report can be found in the <strong>{{ report.test_report_folder }}</strong> subfolder of the
                'archive' folder within the ufotest installation.
            </p>
