class UfotestTestMixin(object):
    """
    This is a custom base class for UnitTest specifically constructed to provide a mock environment for ufotest. To
    be more specific: Before any tests are actually executed, this class constructs a temporary folder in the /tmp
    folder of the system, where it makes a fresh install of ufotest and changes all references to point to this
    installation. If any of the tests interfaces with any files of the installation, those temporary fresh ones are
    being used instead of messing with the users system installation of ufotest.

    **USAGE**

    It is recommended to employ this mixin for every test class which in any capacity interfaces with the ufotest
    config file or any other file. To use it simply define a test class with mutliple inheritance that uses this
    mixin and the standard unittest.TestCase. *It is important that this class is actually listed first!*

    .. code-block:: python

        import unittest
        from ufotest._testing import UfotestTestMixin

        class TestMyStuff(UfotestTestMixin, unittest.TestCase):

            # ... the test methods

    **INHERITANCE VS. MIXIN**

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1323455/python-unit-test-with-base-and-sub-class
    As you might have noticed this class is a "mixin" which is intended to be used in a multiple inheritance scenario
    for those test cases which actually need the ufotest environment. Such a test class would have to inherit from this
    mixin first and from the basic unittest.TestCase second. This is a design choice, where the alternative would have
    been to make this a child class of the basic TestCase class and then have all the actual test classes only inherit
    from this extended test class. But that actually causes problems, because that was the way I had it before. The
    issue ist the following: The pytest test discovery automatically runs every class which inherits from TestCase and
    contains at least one method which starts with "test_" this would then also discover the "raw" base class which is
    present in the namespace of all the test files because it was imported. This causes the base class which is only
    supposed to be a base class for further inheritance and not actually executed as a test itself to be actually
    executed as exactly that multiple times: Once per test file where it is imported. This does not happen with the
    mixin implementation because the mixin obviously does not inherit from TestCase directly...
